"""Connection pooling for DB-API connections.

Provides a number of connection pool implementations for a variety of
usage scenarios and thread behavior requirements imposed by the
application, DB-API or database itself.

Also provides a DB-API 2.0 connection proxying mechanism allowing
regular DB-API connect() methods to be transparently managed by a
SQLAlchemy connection pool.
